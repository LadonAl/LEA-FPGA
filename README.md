# LEA-FPGA
An attempt to make the LEA 128-bit cipher on an FPGA.

# About me:
My name is Alaa, a computer engineer that is interested in math, computer hardware, FPGA's, and some IoT development. 
I am always eager to learn more about FPGA development, if you have a project that you would like me to participate in, please hit me up.

# This Project
As the name implies, this is an attempt to create the LEA-128-bit cipher on an FPGA.Please not that I have no previous experience in cryptography. I simply followed the algotithm in order to come up with this design. 

The final product should have 2 input ports that recieve the 128-bit input key and raw data. It will also have an output terminal that produces the encrypted data.

Today 20-Jun-2019, the project simpy includes the key generator module. This module so far only include combinational logic because I tried my best to avoid using memories.
